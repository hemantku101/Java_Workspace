## LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS

# What is lambda expression?
- A lambda expression is a method without a name, access specifier, and reurn value 
declaration. Lambda Expressions are also know as 'anonymous methods' or 'closures'.

# What is a functionalInterface?
- A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. 
The main advantage of a functional interface is that it can be used to refer to a 
lambda expression or as a method reference. Thus execution of lambda expressions .
or methods can be possible.

# What is the target type of a lambda expression?
- The target type of a lambda expression represents a type to which the expression can be converted. 
All lambda expressions are converted into a functional interface type. So, the target type of a 
lambda expression is functional interface.
